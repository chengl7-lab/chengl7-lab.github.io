## Stochastic alignment of Nanopore data


Oxford Nanopore (ONT) is the third generation sequencing technology. It measures the electric current when a RNA molecule passes through the pore. The current depends on the set of nucleotides in the pore, allowing inference of the nucleotide sequence and possible modifications. A major challenge is the accurate segmentation of the raw signal. According to the translocation hypothesis, the RNA molecule jiggles when it passes through the pore in a stochastic random walk. This makes the segmentation difficult as no clear boundary can be established. We aim to take this into account with a novel approach to nanopore raw signal alignment. Stochastic alignment aims to find probabilistic relative segmentation of the raw signal.
