## KMAP: k-mer Manifold Approximation and Projection for visualizing DNA sequences

A DNA fragment such as “AGCTTTA” is called a kmer, which serves as a fundamental unit of DNA sequence information. Despite its importance as such a basic component, there has been little discussion on the structure and properties of the kmer manifold. We propose KMAP, which starts from mathematical combinatorial theory to characterize the distance space of kmers under the Hamming distance. From the theory of KMAP, we derive a motif discovery algorithm that can act as a lightweight statistical testing tool to identify biological signals in data, such as transcription factor binding site patterns. Furthermore, KMAP can visualize the discovered motif signals. In the final figure, the core motif sequence is placed at the center, while random sequences are placed on the periphery to represent orbits, providing a fascinating demonstration of the structure of the kmer manifold. In addition, we show how KMAP can be applied in various biological scenarios, such as ChIP-seq and gene editing data.
