# Welcome to the Computational Genomics Lab

The Computational Genomics Lab focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods for applications in single cell biology, metagenomics, and epigenetics.

## Our Research

We are dedicated to advancing the field of computational genomics through innovative approaches and cutting-edge research. Our work spans several key areas:

- **Single Cell Biology**: Developing methods to analyze and interpret single-cell data
- **Metagenomics**: Creating tools for studying microbial communities
- **Epigenetics**: Investigating gene regulation and expression patterns
